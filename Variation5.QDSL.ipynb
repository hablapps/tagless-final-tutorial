    "This is an all completely different approach to our problem, based on so-called Quoted DSLs. Unlike MTL, Quoted DSLs don't build upon custom syntax declared through APIs but upon the host language AST (Abstract Syntax Tree, i.e. the Scala syntax itself). And semantics is not given through API instances but through AST transformations, i.e. macros. The application of Quoted DSLs to Language-Integrated Query was one of the key features of the following [paper](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/practical-theory-of-linq.pdf): "
